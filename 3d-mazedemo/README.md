# 3D Javascript Maze

3D Labyrinth written in Javascript. Maze generator was written [earlier](https://github.com/okkindel/MazeGenerator) in Java.  
You control the camera with **arrow keys**, **Shift** for horizontal strafing, and now **mouse movement** for smoother control.  
It uses canvas to draw a minimap and a raycasting system.  
Level creator was also done earlier, during [this](https://github.com/okkindel/TankGame) project.  

Technique was used in Wolfenstein 3D. Some effects were added by me.

## Todo

* ~~Shadows~~  
* ~~Code Optimize~~  
* ~~Maybe level creator?~~

* Prescribe level creator to JavaScript  
* More advanced enemy AI  
* Additional sound and visual effects  
* All ideas are very welcome ðŸš€   





we turned the normal 3D Labyrinth into an 3D Educational Maze - An interactive way to learn pathfinding algorithms through gameplay.
