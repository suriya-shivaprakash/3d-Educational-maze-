3D Maze Game with Pathfinding Algorithms 🎮🧩

An interactive educational 3D maze game built by enhancing an existing open-source project. Our goal is to make learning pathfinding algorithms engaging and fun through gameplay.

🚀 Features 🔍 Pathfinding Algorithms

We integrated five popular algorithms and visualized them on a minimap:

Breadth-First Search (BFS) → Always finds the shortest path.

Depth-First Search (DFS) → Explores deep but not always efficient.

Dijkstra’s Algorithm → Works well with weighted paths.

A* → Fast and accurate, combines heuristics + path cost.

Greedy Best-First Search → Quick but not always optimal.

Players can switch between algorithms and see how each finds different routes.

🎮 Gameplay Enhancements

Mouse-controlled first-person camera 🖱️

Health bar & damage system ❤️‍🩹

Blood effects for realism 🩸

Sound effects 🔊

Fullscreen mode ⛶

Win / Lose conditions 🏆

These features make the game immersive, challenging, and fun.

🎯 Educational Value

This project is not just a maze game — it’s also an interactive learning tool. Players experience how different algorithms behave in real-time, making abstract concepts more understandable and engaging.
